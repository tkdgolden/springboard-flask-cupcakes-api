# Springboard Exercise to practice REST & JSON APIs

In this exercise, you will build a JSON API, test it using Insomnia, write integration tests, and build a HTML/JS frontend.
We are storing a table of cupcakes in a database and using our own API to host routes for a user to access the table.  
A JS frontend makes calls to our server side API and displays the relevant information on the page.
Practice with insomnia shows what is happening within the requests/ responses.
